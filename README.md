What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is a crucial step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It involves creating a basic visual representation of a web page or application’s layout. Think of it as a blueprint that outlines the structure and elements of a page—such as headers, buttons, images, and navigation menus—without focusing on design details like color, fonts, or final graphics.

Why is Wireframing Important?
Wireframes serve several important purposes in the design process:

Clarity and Focus: They help designers, developers, and stakeholders focus on functionality and user flow rather than aesthetics.

Efficient Planning: Wireframes allow teams to plan content layout and page structure efficiently before any coding or high-fidelity design begins.

Feedback and Iteration: They make it easier to gather feedback early in the process, enabling quicker iterations and reducing costly revisions later.

Improved Communication: Wireframes act as a shared visual reference, improving communication among team members and with clients.

In summary, wireframing lays the foundation for a successful design by aligning functionality with user needs early in the development cycle.
